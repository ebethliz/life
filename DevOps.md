Based on QA perspective, the CEO's approach towards DevOps implementation is appropriate. However, it is important to consider the below factors:

DevOps is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Based on specific needs and culture of the organization, the topic of DevOps implementation should be approached differently. The QA team should be involved in the planning process to ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account.

DevOps requires a cultural shift towards collaboration and shared responsibility, which cannot be substituted through implementation of new tools. Tools can only help to automate and streamline tasks. It is important to create a cohesive environment where the QA team, developers and operations staff can all work comfortably in.

Some things that QA team can act on in order to fit into the DevOps team:

Become experts in DevOps principles and practices. The QA team should take the time to learn about DevOps and how it can be used to improve their testing processes. There are many resources available online and in libraries.

Collaborate with developers and operations staff. The QA team should work closely with developers and operations staff to understand the needs of the business and the challenges of delivering high-quality software. The QA team should also be involved in the development and implementation of DevOps tools and processes.

Automate test cases. Automation is a key component of DevOps. The QA team should automate as many test cases as possible to free up time for more exploratory testing and other value-added activities.

Provide feedback and suggestions. The QA team should be proactive in providing feedback and suggestions to the DevOps team. The QA team can also help to identify and mitigate risks. There seems to be be a disconnect, if no guidance is provided from the top on the framework to adopt etc, it might end up in a situation where the existing team's preferred tools conflict with the choice made by the DevOps Teams. 

Overall, the CEO's approach to implementing DevOps is appropriate in principle. However, it is important to involve the QA team in the planning process and to create an environment where the QA team feels comfortable working closely with developers and operations staff.

Here are some additional tips for the QA team to fit in with the DevOps team:

Adopt a DevOps mindset. This means thinking about testing as an integrated part of the software development lifecycle, rather than a separate activity that happens at the end.

Be proactive and communicative. The QA team should proactively identify and resolve potential risks while also sharing their findings and recommendations with developers and operations staff.

Be willing to learn new things. The QA team should be open to learning new tools and technologies. They should also be willing to adapt their testing processes to the needs of the DevOps team.

By doing these things, the QA team can be a vital role in making sure DevOps works well.
